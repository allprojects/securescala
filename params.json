  "body": "Cloud computing offers an attractive and cost-efficient computing platform and hence it has been widely adopted by the industry and the government. At the same time, cloud computing poses a serious security challenge because sensitive data must often be outsourced to third party entities that can access the data and perform computations on them.\r\n\r\nPartial homomorphic encryption is promising for secure computation, since it allows programs to be executed over encrypted data. Despite advances in cryptographic techniques have improved the expressivity of such programs, integration with mainstream languages has seen little progress. To this end, we present SecureScala, a domain-specific language in Scala that allows expressing secure programs without requiring any cryptographic knowledge. SecureScala is based on a novel combination of free monads and free applicative functors and supports parallel execution and static analyzability. We evaluate our approach through several case studies, demonstrate its expressivity, and show that it incurs in limited performance overhead.\r\n\r\nCloud computing offers on-demand provisioning of resources, seemingly unlimited scalability and other desirable properties, e.g., fault tolerance, minimal maintenance and cost reduction. To take advantage of these opportunities, the program representing a computation at hand and the associated data is uploaded into the cloud and executed there. Moving computations to the cloud, however, forces developers to face a number of security challenges. While the cloud is a viable approach for non-sensitive and public data, it is problematic for scenarios where data is sensitive, requiring protection from both adversaries and the cloud provider. Traditional encryption targeted to protect data while passing communication channels does not offer a solution for the cloud-based computation scenario because the program running on the remote hardware is not allowed to decrypt the data during the execution plain text data would be available to the owners of the remote host.\r\n\r\nHomomorphic encryption schemes allow computations over encrypted data. Hence, private data can be uploaded to the cloud and processed in the encrypted form, without leaking information. Available homomorphic encryption schemes differ in the operations they support. Fully homomorphic encryption schemes (FHE) support at least multiplication and addition, from which all other operations can be derived. While in theory FHE seems to be the ulti- mate solution to the problem of computing over encrypted data, the computational overhead makes it unviable in practice. Partial homomorphic encryption (PHE) schemes are less expressive they support computation over encrypted data with respect to specific operations, but in contrast to FHE, exhibit acceptable performance. Examples of such schemes are Paillier (addition), ElGamal (multiplication), OPE (order comparisons) and AES (equality comparisons).\r\n\r\nPHE schemes have been used in several systems to provide practical and provable security [13, 21, 26]. Yet, these approaches adopt special-purpose languages, such as SQL [21] or PigLatin [26] to specify computations. A PHE embedding in a general-purpose language that enables reuse of existing libraries, fostering modularity and composition of secure computations, is still open research.\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef wordCountText(e: EncStr): CryptoM[List[(OpeStr,Int)]] = \r\n              e.split(\"\"\"\\s+\"\"\") >>= wordCount_\r\n\r\ndef wordCount_(es: IList[EncStr]): Crypto[List[(OpeStr,Int)]] = \r\n              es.traverse(toOpeStr).map(\r\n                _.groupBy(x => x).map(_.length).toList)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Academic publications\r\n* Markus Hauck, Savvas Savvides, Patrick Eugster, Mira Mezini and Guido Salvaneschi _SecureScala: Scala Embedding of Secure Computations_ 2016 7th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Scala [[pdf]](http://www.guidosalvaneschi.com/attachments/papers/2016_SecureScala-Scala-Embedding-of-Secure-Computations_pdf.pdf)\r\n* Markus Hauck _A Platform for Secure Distributed Programming_ Master Thesis, TU Darmstadt, 2015\r\n\r\n### About\r\nSecurescala is a project at the Software Technology Group - Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany.
