\TODO
- framework for writing programs working with encrypted data
- expressive dsl to write programs
- for the dsl, use free monads to get a lot of expressive power, use
free applicatives to be able to introspect parts of the program
statically
- static optimizations: run concurrently, batch convert, check how
  many conversions, eliminate trivial conversions
- programmer writes in monadic style, the dsl parts use applicative
  style which get's lifted (implicitly) where required
