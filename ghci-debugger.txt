2.5. The GHCi Debugger

GHCi contains a simple imperative-style debugger in which you can stop a running computation in order to examine the values of variables. The debugger is integrated into GHCi, and is turned on by default: no flags are required to enable the debugging facilities. There is one major restriction: breakpoints and single-stepping are only available in interpreted modules; compiled code is invisible to the debugger[5].

The debugger provides the following:

    The ability to set a breakpoint on a function definition or expression in the program. When the function is called, or the expression evaluated, GHCi suspends execution and returns to the prompt, where you can inspect the values of local variables before continuing with the execution.

    Execution can be single-stepped: the evaluator will suspend execution approximately after every reduction, allowing local variables to be inspected. This is equivalent to setting a breakpoint at every point in the program.

    Execution can take place in tracing mode, in which the evaluator remembers each evaluation step as it happens, but doesn't suspend execution until an actual breakpoint is reached. When this happens, the history of evaluation steps can be inspected.

    Exceptions (e.g. pattern matching failure and error) can be treated as breakpoints, to help locate the source of an exception in the program.

There is currently no support for obtaining a "stack trace", but the tracing and history features provide a useful second-best, which will often be enough to establish the context of an error. For instance, it is possible to break automatically when an exception is thrown, even if it is thrown from within compiled code (see Section 2.5.6, "Debugging exceptions").

2.5.1. Breakpoints and inspecting variables

Let's use quicksort as a running example. Here's the code:

qsort [] = []
qsort (a:as) = qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right
  where (left,right) = (filter (<=a) as, filter (>a) as)

main = print (qsort [8, 4, 0, 3, 1, 23, 11, 18])

First, load the module into GHCi:

Prelude> :l qsort.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( qsort.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main>


Now, let's set a breakpoint on the right-hand-side of the second equation of qsort:

*Main> :break 2
Breakpoint 0 activated at qsort.hs:2:15-46
*Main>

The command :break 2 sets a breakpoint on line 2 of the most recently-loaded module, in this case qsort.hs. Specifically, it picks the leftmost complete subexpression on that line on which to set the breakpoint, which in this case is the expression (qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right).

Now, we run the program:

*Main> main
Stopped at qsort.hs:2:15-46
_result :: [a]
a :: a
left :: [a]
right :: [a]
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main>

Execution has stopped at the breakpoint. The prompt has changed to indicate that we are currently stopped at a breakpoint, and the location: [qsort.hs:2:15-46]. To further clarify the location, we can use the :list command:

[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main> :list
1  qsort [] = []
2  qsort (a:as) = qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right
3    where (left,right) = (filter (<=a) as, filter (>a) as)
